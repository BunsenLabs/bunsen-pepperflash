pepperflashplugin-adobe-nonfree
===============================

This package will download and unpack the PPAPI flash plugin directly from Adobe.
Configuration files for chromium and browser-plugin-freshplayer-pepperflash
will be installed so that those applications can use the plugin.

The end user license agreement is available at Adobe.

NOTE: no checksum verification of the downloaded file is performed.

NOTE: This is an experimental package.
File names and the package name itself may change with any official release.

NOTE: The "notify-broadcast" folder content will probably be moved 
to a different package in the future, again, maybe with different names.
