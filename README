bunsen-pepperflash
==================

This package will download and unpack the PPAPI flash plugin directly from Adobe.
Configuration files for chromium and browser-plugin-freshplayer-pepperflash
will be installed so that those applications can use the plugin.

Chromium will be able to use the downloaded plugin immediately,
but for Mozilla browsers the package
browser-plugin-freshplayer-pepperflash must also be installed.

The end user license agreement is available at Adobe.
This package itself does not contain any software from Adobe.

NOTE: no checksum verification of the downloaded file is performed.

USAGE: The installed script /usr/sbin/update-bunsen-pepperflash is
run automatically on install or uninstall of this package,
but can also be run manually.
Run 'update-bunsen-pepperflash --help' to see options.

A systemd timer will run the upgrade check every day.
To change this behaviour, copy /lib/systemd/system/bunsen-pepperflash.timer to
/etc/systemd/system/bunsen-pepperflash.timer, edit the latter file, and
run 'systemctl reenable bunsen-pepperflash.timer'.

If the recommended package bunsen-utilities is also installed,
popup notifications of plugin upgrades or script errors will be displayed.
