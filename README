bunsen-pepperflash
==================

This package will download and unpack the PPAPI flash plugin directly from Adobe.
Configuration files for chromium and browser-plugin-freshplayer-pepperflash
will be installed so that those applications can use the plugin.

The end user license agreement is available at Adobe.
This package itself does not contain any software from Adobe.

NOTE: no checksum verification of the downloaded file is performed.

USAGE: The installed script /usr/sbin/update-bunsen-pepperflash is
run automatically on install or uninstall of this package,
but can also be run manually.
Run 'update-bunsen-pepperflash --help' to see options.

A systemd timer will run the upgrade check every day.
To change this behaviour, copy /lib/systemd/system/bunsen-pepperflash.timer to 
/etc/systemd/system/bunsen-pepperflash.timer, edit the latter file, and
run 'systemctl reenable bunsen-pepperflash.timer'.

If the recommended package bunsen-utilities is also installed, 
popup notifications of plugin upgrades or script errors will be displayed.
